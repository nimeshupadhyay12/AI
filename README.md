## 1. What is reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning: An Overview
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning focused on making decisions to maximize cumulative rewards in a given situation. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on a training dataset with predefined answers, RL involves learning through experience. In RL, an agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment by performing actions and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning
Agent: The learner or decision-maker.
Environment: Everything the agent interacts with.
State: A specific situation in which the agent finds itself.
Action: All possible moves the agent can make.
Reward: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken.
How Reinforcement Learning Works
RL operates on the principle of learning optimal behavior through trial and error. The agent takes actions within the environment, receives rewards or penalties, and adjusts its behavior to maximize the cumulative reward. This learning process is characterized by the following elements:

Policy: A strategy used by the agent to determine the next action based on the current state.
Reward Function: A function that provides a scalar feedback signal based on the state and action.
Value Function: A function that estimates the expected cumulative reward from a given state.
Model of the Environment: A representation of the environment that helps in planning by predicting future states and rewards.
Example: Navigating a Maze. 


Main points in Reinforcement learning â€“ 
Input: The input should be an initial state from which the model will start
Output: There are many possible outputs as there are a variety of solutions to a particular problem
Training: The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.
The model keeps continues to learn.
The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward.
